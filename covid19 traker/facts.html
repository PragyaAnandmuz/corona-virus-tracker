        <p class="Question">
            What is COVID-19?
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
            COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.

        <p class="Question">
            What happens to people who get COVID-19?
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
            Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.
            About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
        
            Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis
            and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.
        
            In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
        </p>
        <p class="Question">
            When should I get a test for COVID-19?
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
            Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact
            with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow
            their guidance.
        
            While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is
            limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at
            higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care
            facilities.

        <p class="Question">
            I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
            Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms.
            Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in
            response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a
            person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection
            or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past.
