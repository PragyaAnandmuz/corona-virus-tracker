        <p class="Question">
            Get Vaccinated
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because
                of
                the pandemic.
            </li>

        <p class="Question">
            Wear a mask
        </p>
        <p class="Answer">
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.
            </li>
            <li>
                In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for
                activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.
            </li>
            <li>
                People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully
                protected
                even if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated
                people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it
                to
                others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public
                transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at U.S. transportation
                hubs
                such as airports and stations. Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance
                (like
                on open deck areas of a ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).
